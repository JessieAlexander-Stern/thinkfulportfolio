       <h2> About Jessie</h2>

<p>I was a music teacher for 15 years and worked the past 2 years in social work. Recently when
    I decided I was ready for a career change I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I love
    challenging myself with complex problem solving and being able to be creative as well.
</p>
<p>Currently I am a student at Thinkful. I'm so glad I took this step and I'm excited to get to work in such an exciting field.</p>
<p>I have experience with the following through my training at Thinkful.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <lI>CSS</lI>
    <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking to hire a new developer or need fiddler to join your jam please feel free to reach out.</p>
